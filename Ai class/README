To run our program we have to first generate a sample graph that will be used.
We can do this by typing this in the terminal when you are in our directory.
python3 generateSample.py
This will ask questions or how big the graph should be and the start end point. Make sure that you name the file sample
as then it will make it into a .txt file.
Now to run the Visualizer input this into the terminal
python3 visualizer.py sample.txt
This will generate the graph in a new window. Next we have to go back to the terminal where we orginally ran it and then
pick if you want to run A* or Theta*. You will type in a or t to chose which one. Once this is done it will shows the
indices that are used and will draw the path on the window that was open before. It also displays the runtime on the bottom
NOTE: As of right now this program will only run if sample.txt is used as that is what the program calls for. If you
would like to use a different file with a different name then it must be changed in visualizer toward the bottom.
